# Team Profile Generator

## My Repository

In this GitHub repository, you will find my completed Team Profile Generator. My task was to create a command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person, using a user's input from Node.js and the Inquirer package. I was also required to run tests using Jest, and to create a walkthrough video demonstrating the application. The purpose of this application is to make it easy for a software development team manager to create a rota for their team and to provide an easy way of reviewing this team with brief but essential info about each member.

## Installation

To install this project, you may either clone this repository to a local directory, or fork the repository to your own GitHub. After having installed Node.js, you must then install the inquirer module using `npm i inquirer` in the command line. Then you will be able to run the application by typing `node index.js`, and then follow the inline instructions. [This video]() demonstrates exactly how to do all of this, with a sample of the generated webpage [here]().

## Software Used

This project was completed using Visual Studio Code, the command line, Node.js and the Inquirer and File system packages.

## Conclusion

Overall, I found the development of this application quite challenging, though I do believe I met the criteria. In the future, I would like to improve my testing skills using Jest.
